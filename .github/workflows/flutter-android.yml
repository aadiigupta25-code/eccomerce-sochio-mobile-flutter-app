# Notes:
# - This workflow produces an unsigned release APK by default. For a fully
#   signed release build you must provide your Android keystore and passwords
#   as GitHub Secrets and modify this workflow to decode the keystore and
#   create a `key.properties` file before the `flutter build` step.
# - Recommended secrets (example names):
#   - ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64  (base64 of the keystore file)
#   - ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
#   - ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS
#   - ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
# - To build an AAB instead of an APK, replace the build command with:
#     flutter build appbundle --release
